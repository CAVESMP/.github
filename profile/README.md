# CAVESMP on GitHub
We share on the GitHub our modpacks, server files, discord bot, website & more to our server members/ developers & some to the public.

## FAQ
### What repos could be open for public?
Our modpacks & assets (like logos, wallpapers, etc) are likely to be open for the public somewhere in the future.
Our repos of our website(s), files we use for the server hosting & discord bot(s) are very & very unlikely to be open for the public to see.
Don't get your hopes up, all the repositories can be private indefinitely at all times.

### How can I join the CAVESMP?
The CAVESMP is a private SMP. Only close friends of the members can get a invite to join the SMP.
Do not ask for an invite at all times.

### How can I be a developer for the CAVESMP?
Only server members of the CAVESMP can help develop the CAVESMP (from creating a modpack to developing & updating a website with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP & MySQL to creating a Minecraft mod with Java).
If you are a member of the CAVESMP and want access to the Organization, hit me up in the Discord server!
